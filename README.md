The study focuses on network analysis of projects developed by a humanitarian association, namely Tulime, in the plateau surrounding the village of Pomerini, Tanzania, where Tulime is operating in the perspective of Community Cooperation since 2014. Data was obtained from the association itself through the disclosure of spreadsheets and textual data regarding each of the projects: data was then treated to complete missing gaps through statistical attribution of values based on available or literature derived ones. This allowed to generate a network referring to each village then meshed into one analysing the association’s intervention as a whole. Networks were then analysed in order to develop a model of project’s distribution and with measures drawn by three articles treating similar topics, later use for confrontation, comparison and discussion of results.
